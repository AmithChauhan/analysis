1) Simple Moving Average
A simple moving average (SMA) is an arithmetic moving average calculated by adding recent prices and 
then dividing that figure by the number of time periods in the calculation average.
The simplest use of an SMA in technical analysis is using it to quickly determine if an asset is in an uptrend or downtrend.
